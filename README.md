# resume-book-builder
Builder to create resume books for different organizations. This builder was created for the the Women in Computing organization at Northwestern University.

## Installation
Make sure the pdfrw python library is downloaded on your machine. To do so, enter the command "pip install pdfrw."

## To run
Ensure you have a directory in the same directory as the script called "resumes." Then ru
n "python resume-book-builder.py" from the command line. The resulting pdf is titled "resume-book.pdf."

## Errors
This script takes advantage of the logging capabilities of the pdfrw library. I may or may not add more error checking capabilities to improve the reliability of the script.
